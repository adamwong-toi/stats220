Repository for STATS 220 at UoA - S1 2025

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Statistics and Chemistry (under a BA/BSc) I am in my final semester.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I wanted to take more statistics papers to fulfil my degree requirements whilst also being genuinely interested in the content and learning valuable skills for my future studies in the field. I don't have any major requirements left for Statistics, so wanted to fill my final few papers with enjoyable, yet useful papers. 
- I am interested in learning about data wrangling, different techniques in R, and becoming more proficient at programming/using the tidyverse package in R
